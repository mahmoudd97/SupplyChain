# SupplyChain
### Project Introduction

Supply chains are a vital component of any organizationâ€™s success, contributing to meeting market needs and delivering products on time. With the increasing complexity of logistics operations, many companies face significant challenges related to shipping goods. This project aims to analyze supply chain data to determine if there are issues affecting the shipping process.

We will review various factors that may affect shipping efficiency, including delivery times and shipping error rates. A key focus of our analysis will be to ensure that the percentage of delayed shipments does not exceed 5% of the total shipped orders. By maintaining this threshold, we aim to enhance shipping efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Through this analysis, we seek to provide clear insights that help improve logistics operations and enhance customer satisfaction. Understanding shipping issues can greatly contribute to enhancing the operational efficiency and competitiveness of the organization in the market.

Through this project, we aim to provide data-driven recommendations to address any existing issues and ensure smooth operations in the future.
